Gold wheat needs gold blocks, diamond seeds need diamond blocks and so on. By default, netherite scrap seeds need an ancient debris to convert."

If you harvest a fully grown resource wheat, the chance that it'll drop an extra seed is small, meaning it might take you lots of harvests before you have enough seeds to build a decently sized farm.$(br2)Don't worry though, there's techniques to combat these difficulties discussed in later chapters."
